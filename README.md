Description:
A Linear Regression Model with validating its assumptions.
Linear Regression is all about finding the best fit line.

This is project in which I applied Linear Regression Model, validating it's assumptions which are:
1. **Linearity** : This assumption assumes that each indepedent variable has a linear relationship with the Dependent Variable.
2. **Homoscedastity** : This assumption states that the residuals have less variance in residuals.
3. **Non-Multicollinearity** : This assumptions tells that the independent features must ne non-collinear.
4. **Normailty** : This assumptio states that the residuals are normally distributed.
