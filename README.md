# Linear-Regression
A Linear Regression Model with validating its assumptions.

This is project in which I applied Linear Regression Model, validating it's assumptions which are:
1. **Linearity** : This assumption assumes that each indepedent variable has a linear relationship with the Dependent Variable.
2. **Homoscedastity** : This assumption states that the residuals have less variance in residuals.
3. **Non-Multicollinearity** : This assumptions tells that the independent features must ne non-collinear.
4. **Normailty** : This assumptio states that the residuals are normally distributed.


I have also done a complete documentation, please look into the attached pdf.

# Work Done:
1.EDA on independent variable(s) and dependent variable and answering a few questions as per my knowledge using various visulizational techniques.
2.Wrote custom functions for various repetitive tasks.
3.Linearity assumption check on each independent variable.
4.Handling of outliers.
5.Removal of columns which do not satisfy the linear regression assumptions.
6.Validation of model using R-Square and residual plot.
